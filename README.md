## Description:
With Muliple Linear Regression Model, the Advertising data (Advertising.csv) is used to see an approximate linear relationship between the response variable (Sales) and each of the predictor variables (TV, Radio, and Newspaper), as well as correlation among the predictors variables.
This model can predict Sales by TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising media budgets.
Based on those three predictor variables, this program performs the Hypothesis Test which use F-test statistic of the full model to determine if there is at least one predictor related to the response variable as Sales. 
Then, there is another hypothesis testing using anova function to test the reduced model without all the predictors. This model also show the effect of multicolinearity between variables.

## Concepts:
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. F-Test
3. Partial F-Test
4. Multicolinearity
